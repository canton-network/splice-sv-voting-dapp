      - PostgreSQL Data Checksums

          - `PostgreSQL data checksums <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/checksums.html>`_ are now
            **enabled by default** for all PostgreSQL databases created by Splice. This applies to the
            in-cluster Postgres Helm chart (``splice-postgres``) and the Docker-Compose based deployments
            (SV, validator and LocalNet). Data checksums help detect on-disk data corruption early.

            .. warning::

               Data checksums can only be enabled when a database cluster is first initialized
               (``initdb``). **Enabling them by default
               only affects freshly initialized databases.** Existing deployments are *not* automatically
               migrated and will continue to run without data checksums until they are explicitly enabled.

               Operators of existing deployments should enable checksums on
               their existing databases out-of-band, for example by stopping PostgreSQL and running
               ``pg_checksums --enable`` against the data directory (see the
               `pg_checksums documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-pgchecksums.html>`_).

          - Splice nodes now perform a best-effort check at startup and log a ``WARN`` if PostgreSQL
            data checksums are not enabled on their backing database. This check never fails startup.
